# Defacement-detection-app
Application that employs CNN to detect defacement.  
Dataset is crawled from Zone.h including 1700 defaced and 2500 benign web screenshots.  
The crawler software is also an interesting aspect. It is also trained on CNN/Transformer to break Zone.h noisy captcha which in my opinion is extremely annoying.
